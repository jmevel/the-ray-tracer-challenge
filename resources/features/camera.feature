Feature: Camera

Scenario: Rendering a world with a camera
  Given w ← default_world()
    And c ← camera(11, 11, π/2)
    And from ← point(0, 0, -5)
    And to ← point(0, 0, 0)
    And up ← vector(0, 1, 0)
    And c.transform ← view_transform(from, to, up)
  When image ← render(c, w)
  Then pixel_at(image, 5, 5) = color(0.38066, 0.47583, 0.2855)
